Hello there!

I am a final year undergraduate pursuing a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).  My research interests include observational and computational cosmology, CMB physics, 21 cm cosmology and physics of reionization and galaxy formation and evolution. 

I am currently working on my final year project with [Prof. Sriramkumar](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~sriram/index.html) from IIT Madras, where I am developing a code to compute correlations generated during inflation and eventually utilize them to compare models of the early universe with the cosmological data.

This summer, I worked with [Prof. Divya Oberoi](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~div/index.html) at the [National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA-TIFR)](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main) on using Total Electron Content measurements from GPS receivers and International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) to describe the ionosphere around the GMRT. 

You can find more details about these projects here.
