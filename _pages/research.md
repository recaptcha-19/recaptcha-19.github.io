These are some of the research projects I have worked/currently working on. 

## Comparison of models of the early universe with cosmological data

Two problems with the standard model of cosmology, i.e. the horizon and flatness problems are explained by an epoch of accelerated expansion in the early universe, termed as inflation. The large scale structure of the universe is seeded by primordial perturbations which were generated during inflation. These perturbations leave their imprints as anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). 

Current work in the project is on generating a highly efficient code to compute scalar and tensor power spectra for a given inflationary potential. This code as well as code for generating phase plots for specific inflationary potentials and the behaviour of associated slow-roll parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/recaptcha-19/Cosmology). The aim is to develop code to compute correlations generated during inflation. This will eventually be used to compare models of the early universe with cosmological data. 
 
## Exploring the ionosphere around GMRT using IRI and GPS data

The ionosphere is a dispersive medium which causes effects such as propagation delay and Faraday rotation in radio waves. These effects become important to correct for when carrying out observational studies of astronomical objects in the radio regime. The [International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)](http://irimodel.org/) is a globally accepted model which predicts diurnal and seasonal variations of physical observables associated with the ionosphere. However, the IRI doesn't take into account a geomagnetic effect known as the equatorial anomaly and thus, is not expected to give highly accurate predictions for equatorial regions.

This project carries out a comparative study of predictions given by IRI and measurements of Total Electron Content (TEC) from data obtained from GPS receivers. It is seen that the IRI underpredicts vertical TEC for the entire dataset (spanning from September 2017 to December 2018). Codes for generating related plots and visualizations can be found [here](https://github.com/recaptcha-19/Ionospheric-structures). Further scope involves better calibration of data and expanding the dataset to include more years. 

This becomes especially important when using the 21 cm line for observational studies.
